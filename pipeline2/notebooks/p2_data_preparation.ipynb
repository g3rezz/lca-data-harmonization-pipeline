The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The composition (expressed as percentage in mass) is Clinker 71,53, Limestone 23,21, Secondary costituent (EN 197-1) 0,15, Gypsum natural 1,25, Gypsum chemical 3,84, Reducing Chromium agent 0,03. The cement is produced in the plant of Gubbio (PG) of Colacem S.p.A. . The main raw materials and constituents used are marl, limestone, ,gypsum. Beyond cave and mines, to save natural raw materials, when is possible, are used secondary materials, as planned by Best Available Technologies (BAT). The cement studied is CEM II/B-LL 32,5 R bagged cement. The declared unit is 1.000 kg of cement. The amount of cement produced in the reference period year 2023, is 72.863,530 ton. The system boundaries include the aggregated modules A1-A3 and A4, A5 separately according to from cradle to gate with options application, in line with the amended EN 15804 Standard. The construction, maintenance and decommissioning of infrastructures have not been considered, since their contribution to the environmental impact relating to the declared unit is negligible. The cut-off criteria are set at 1, in terms of mass, energy and environmental relevance. This means that a process is neglected if it is responsible for less than 1 of the total mass, primary energy and total impact. However, all the processes for which the data are available are taken into consideration, even if with a contribution of less than 1. The cement production is modelled through primary data collected at Gubbio Colacem S.p.A. plant for the reference period. Allocation is avoided whenever possible by dividing the system into sub-systems. When the allocation cannot be avoided, mass allocation is applied. For the modeling of waste, the Polluter pays principle is applied. The environmental potential impacts, for 1 ton of cement, are listed at Tables at pgg.9-10 of present EPD Report, to which we refer for notes and details.

The composition (expressed as percentage in mass) is Clinker 70,97, Setting regulator 2,70, Pozzolan 25,88, Ferrous sulfate 0,43, Additives 0,02. The cement is produced in the plant of RAGUSA (RG) of RAGUSA CEMENTI S.p.A.. The main raw materials and constituents used for a typical clinker and cement are limestone, clay, gypsum, pozzolan. Beyond cave and mines, to save natural raw materials, when is possible, are used secondary materials, as planned by Best Available Technologies (BAT). The cement studied CEM IV/A (P) 42,5 R - SR. The declared unit is 1.000 kg of cement. The amount of cement produced in the reference period, year 2022, is 18.862,706 ton. The system boundaries include the modules A1, A2 and A3 according to from cradle to gate application, in line with the amended EN 15804 Standard. The construction, maintenance and decommissioning of infrastructures have not been considered, since their contribution to the environmental impact relating to the declared unit is negligible. The cut-off criteria are set at 1, in terms of mass, energy and environmental relevance. This means that a process is neglected if it is responsible for less than 1 of the total mass, primary energy and total impact. However, all the processes for which the data are available are taken into consideration, even if with a contribution of less than 1. The cement production is modelled through primary data collected at RAGUSA (RG) of RAGUSA CEMENTI S.p.A. . plant for the reference period. Allocation is avoided whenever possible by dividing the system into sub-systems. When the allocation cannot be avoided, mass allocation is applied. For the modeling of waste, the Polluter pays principle is applied. The environmental potential impacts, for 1 ton of cement, are listed at pg.8-9 of present EPD Report, to which we refer for notes and details.

The composition (expressed as percentage in mass) is Clinker 58,47, Pozzolan 36,04, Gypsum natural 5,37, Grinding additive 0,043, Reducing Chromium agents 0,0310,045. The cement is produced in the plant of Sesto Campano (IS) of Colacem S.p.A.. The main raw materials and constituents used are limestone, clay, gypsum and pozzolan. Beyond cave and mines, to save natural raw materials, when is possible, are used secondary materials, as planned by Best Available Technologies (BAT). The cement studied is CEM IV/B (P) 32,5 R - LH/SR. The declared unit is 1.000 kg of cement. The amount of cement produced in the reference period, year 2023, is 103.621,854 ton. The system boundaries include the aggregate modules A1-A3 according to from cradle to gate application, in line with the amended EN 15804 Standard. The construction, maintenance and decommissioning of infrastructures have not been considered, since their contribution to the environmental impact relating to the declared unit is negligible. The cut-off criteria are set at 1, in terms of mass, energy and environmental relevance. This means that a process is neglected if it is responsible for less than 1 of the total mass, primary energy and total impact. However, all the processes for which the data are available are taken into consideration, even if with a contribution of less than 1. The cement production is modelled through primary data collected at Sesto Campano Colacem S.p.A. plant for the reference period. Allocation is avoided whenever possible by dividing the system into sub-systems. When the allocation cannot be avoided, mass allocation is applied. For the modeling of waste, the Polluter pays principle is applied. The environmental potential impacts, for 1 ton of cement, are listed at pgg.9-10 of present EPD Report, to which we refer for notes and details.

This mixture is then used for the liquid component filling, after which the valve crimping is carried out to ensure the products integrity. The propellant filling stage follows, with an automatic weight check to ensure accuracy. Can shaking, can cupping, and straw placement then take place. Finally, the cans are packed and palletized for distribution. -No additional processes or raw materials are needed during the use stage of the assessed product. Hence, modules B1 to B7 are not considered. -The End-of-Life scenario for the products has been provided by Henkel, where it is assumed that 60 goes to landfill whilst 40 goes to recycling operations. This scenario is more conservative than the one provided by Eurostat for Construction and Demolition waste which has a higher recycling and landfilling operations rate (usually including more valuable materials than mortars such as metals).

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The cement used for the production of the concrete covered by this EPD is produced at the Colacem S.p.A. plant in Caravate (VA) and its environmental performance is reported in another EPD report (EPDITALY0042). The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The cement used for the production of the concrete covered by this EPD is produced at the Colacem S.p.A. plant in Caravate (VA) and its environmental performance is reported in another EPD report (EPDITALY0042). The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.

The cement section is consists of storage silos connected to a weighbridge, the extraction and loading of the cement into the truck mixer takes place via closed augers. The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity. The shipment of the final product is carried out using special truck mixers. The concretes subject to analysis comply with the requirements of the REACH regulation.
