The suction system and filters guarantee the abatement of dust during loading of the truck mixers. The coarse aggregate (Gravel or commercially Cobblestone) is unloaded directly into a hopper from the tipper trucks owned by the supplier and is then transferred by means of belts from the hopper on the ground to the loading ones. The same applies for sand. The additives are dosed separately using volumetric dosers, whereas the mixing water is dosed with electromechanical ms. All the components described above are conveyed into the concrete mixer barrel where the homogenization and mixing phases take place the energy required for the production of concrete is given by electricity.

This means that a process is neglected if it is responsible for less than 1 of the total mass, primary energy and total impact. However, all the processes for which the data are available are taken into consideration, even if with a contribution of less than 1. The cement production is modelled through primary data collected at Sesto Campano Colacem S.p.A. plant for the reference period. Allocation is avoided whenever possible by dividing the system into sub-systems. When the allocation cannot be avoided, mass allocation is applied. For the modeling of waste, the Polluter pays principle is applied. The environmental potential impacts, for 1 ton of cement, are listed at pgg.9-10 of present EPD Report, to which we refer for notes and details.",

This mixture is then used for the liquid component filling, after which the valve crimping is carried out to ensure the products integrity. The propellant filling stage follows, with an automatic weight check to ensure accuracy. Can shaking, can cupping, and straw placement then take place. Finally, the cans are packed and palletized for distribution. -No additional processes or raw materials are needed during the use stage of the assessed product. Hence, modules B1 to B7 are not considered. -The End-of-Life scenario for the products has been provided by Henkel, where it is assumed that 60 goes to landfill whilst 40 goes to recycling operations. This scenario is more conservative than the one provided by Eurostat for Construction and Demolition waste which has a higher recycling and landfilling operations rate (usually including more valuable materials than mortars such as metals).",

The metallic coated base steel (G550S strength grade) conforms to AS 1397:2021: Continuous hot-dip metallic coated steel sheet and strip - Coatings of zinc and zinc alloyed with aluminium and magnesium. The paint system meets the performance requirements of AS/NZS 2728:2013: Prefinished/pre painted sheet metal products for interior/exterior building applications - Performance requirements. The steel is manufactured from raw and recycled materials to produce hot rolled coil which is then cold reduced through pickling (acid cleaning) process and followed by cold rolling process. The coil then goes through metallic coating line and finally, through the painting line before being packaged and shipped to customer. ",

BATCH MIXER: Mix of raw materials (silica, soda ash, lime, feldspar and dolomite) to which is added recycled glass (cullet) and other compounds depending on the desired color and properties. 2. FUSION FURNACE: Raw materials are melted at 1,550C in a furnace. 3. FLOAT: The molten glass is fed into a bath of molten tin. The glass floats on this flat surface and is drawn off in a ribbon. Serrated wheels, or top rolls, pull and push the glass sideways depending on the desired thickness. 4. ANNEALING LEHR: The glass is lifted onto conveyor rollers and passes through a controlled cooling tunnel measuring more than 100 ms in length. Approximately 600C at the start of this step, the glass exits the lehr at room temperature. 5. CUTTING AND STACKING: The glass is automatically cut lengthwise and crosswise. The sheets of glass are raised by vacuum frames that then place them on glass stillages. 6. QUALITY: Automatic inspections and regular samples are taken to check the quality of the glass at each step in the glassmaking process. 7. STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION: The stillages are placed on storage racks in the warehouse. 8. ENVIRONMENT: Use of recycled cullet, installation of pollution abatement systems and closed-circuit management of water: every measure is taken to limit the consumption of energy, extraction of natural resources, production of waste and emissions into the atmosphere. After the production, coatings are applied off-line independently of the float glass manufacturing process, with two additional steps: 1. CLEANING: the sheet of glass is cleaned in the automatic washing machine using roller brushes, sprays, scrubbing bridges and air knives. It is essential that the surface is perfectly clean to avoid any coating defects. 2. MAGNETRON COATINGS: the glass passes through a tightly sealed pumping chamber, in which the vacuum is formed. Multiple layers of metals, metal and non-metal oxides and nitrides are then applied to the glass using a magnetically enhanced cathodic sputtering method. The resultant thin and transparent coating offers thermal insulation, solar control properties The flat glass is transported on dedicated racks, used many times.

         "The fibre materials arrive from various sources in bales which are broken open and the polypropylene packaging is removed. The fibre is then passed to the carding line, where it is weighed onto the belt and carded to give a fine web. The carded web passes to a needle puncher to produce a needle punched mat. This is edge trimmed, with the trimmings returned to the process. The mat then passes to the latex line to produce the fibre bonded sheet. For tiling products, a scrim is applied and this is needle punched. The scrim can be applied to the back, or it may be in the middle. The scrimmed mat then passes to the latex coater. After coating, drying and cooling, the scrimmed mat passes through rollers, prior to delivery to the bitumen coating line. The yarns for the tufted tile products arrive on bobbins from different sources. The yarns are applied to the scrim to give a loop pile, or a cut pile finish, before being transferred to the latex line. All material (tiled and fibre bonded sheet) passes through latex coater, after which it is oven dried in a mains gas-fuelled oven, then an ambient air cooler. Tiled products are transferred to the bitumen coater, whereas the fibre-bonded mat products are not bitumen coated. In the bitumen line, a polypropylene and a glass fibre scrim are applied to the back of the mat as well as hot bitumen. The bitumen-backed material passes through calender rollers and then nip rollers, then an air cooler and finally over a water-cooled metal plate. The material is then cut on a guillotine, packed in cardboard boxes and wrapped in polyethylene before despatch. Wastes arise from edge trimmings of finished tiles and carpets, plus some production rejects. There are also waste arisings from delivery packaging.",

         "ResourceCo processes Construction and Demolition (CandD) waste materials in South Australia (SA) consisting of asphalt, concrete, bricks, and rubble. This waste is then used to manufacture a range of recycled aggregates products. ResourceCo receives CandD waste from several sites close to the recycling facilities. The material is either dropped for free or received under a small fee. At the recycling facility, the CandD waste are weighted in a weighbridge. The initial sorting gives three streams: ferrous, non-ferrous (bricks, concrete, asphalt, masonry, etc), and non-recyclables. Ferrous materials are sold as scrap and non-recyclables are sent to landfill (inert materials) or incineration for energy production (wood and plastics). Non-ferrous materials are then sent to the crushing and screening steps. Following this, they undergo grading and sorting based on their size. Different size fractions, including coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and fill materials, are categorised. This grading process is crucial to ensure that the recycled aggregates conform to specific size and quality standards suitable for their intended use in construction projects. Sorted products are stocked in pugmills or stockpiles before customer dispatch. Some material undergoes a treatment with cement coating  this product has specific uses and the treatment happens after the recycled aggregate production described in this report. These products are not included in the EPD. The feedstock materials before cement treatment are the same as the materials sorted ready to be stocked. Hence, the cement treatment step was divided from the unit process into a sub-process that is outside this LCAs scope. Water is mostly used for dust control. Dust control is also aided with an orange peel-based product. Some water is also used in washing step of some of the aggregates. As there is no water measurement for the washing step, water is allocated as the other overheads.",
