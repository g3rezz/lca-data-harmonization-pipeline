      "Description: such as packing and internal transportation. The raw materials that arrive at the manufacturing plant are transferred up to the production site. The majority of liquid components are automatically transported from the storage silos to the liquid mixer. All materials are mixed at room temperature. Module A3 is divided into: 1. Manufacturing process 2. Packaging material that leaves the factory with the final product plastic packaging. 3. Production and disposal of wastes resulting from raw materials packaging. The chemicals are supplied to the factory in either Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBC) or plastic drums which are reused or sold. This step assumes a worst case scenario of no reuse and the plastic packaging is transported to a landfill for disposal.\n",
      "Applicability: DURALATEX is a synthetic resin polymer which is supplied as a ready to use liquid. It is designed to improve the qualities of site-batched cementitious mortars and slurries. Being resistant to hydrolysis, it is ideal for internal and external applications in conjunction with cement. It improves adhesion of thin section cement patches, mortars and screeds to their substrates. DURACURE WBW is a concrete curing compound used to create a non-penetrating continuous film immediately upon contact with a cementious surface. It is a low viscosity, wax emulsion, water-based concrete-curing compound. It is applied to green concrete or fresh cementitious surfaces as a nonpenetrating film, which appears white after application but then dries to a clear film. It is used for curing of large concrete surface areas, such as airport aprons, concrete roads and bridge structures as well as all general applications. The film prevents excessive water evaporation which permits more efficient cement hydration.\n",

Hence, screw production in Taiwan falls under A1 Raw material. The screw is manufactured by a supplier with factory in Kaohsiung City in Taiwan. The raw material to the screw manufacturing is steel wire and production process includes drawing the wire, forging and treading into desired screw shape. Lastly the screw is heat treated for better mechanical strength and surface treated. Finished screw is transported by boat and truck (assumed to be freight lorry, 16-32t, EURO5, powered with diesel) to Vstsvensk Byggskruv were packaging and warehousing takes place. During Vstsvensk Byggskruvs operation, electricity and heat is used, and a small amount of production waste is created. Vstsvensk Byggskruv produces their own solar energy via solar panels on the roof, and the electricity been modelled with 14 solarenergy and 86 Swedish residual mix. This electricity mix has a climate impact (GWP-GHG) of 0,082 kg CO2 eq/kWh. The finished products are packaged in different packaging solutions before distributed to customer. The distribution transport (A4) is modelled with ruck, freight lorry 16-32t, EURO6, powered with diesel fuel, 249 km. After use the product is transported to waste processing and the steel is assumed to be recycled with an 86 collection and recovery. In the C module no environmental impact of deconstruction is assumed to occur (C1), as well as any environmental impact from recycling is not considered following the cut-off approach applied (C3). What is considered in the C module is the transportation to waste processing which is assumed to occur with truck 50km (C2), sorting and preparation of steel scrap for recycling (C3) were the 86 share is recycled, and disposal (landfill) of waste not sent for recycling (C4) which is 14 of the steel.\n",

      "Applicability: Linear drains are rectilinear polymer concrete forms that allow water to be collected and guided to the point of discharge, preventing flooding. A full range of drainages is available for various applications: pedestrian and vehicle use or for heavy-duty areas such as ports, docks and airports. The product range is:  Domestic drainage: Self, Mini, Urban, Sport.  Technical drainage: MultiV  Civil drainage: Civil  S, Civil  F, KompaqDrain The drainage channels are made of polymer concrete. This is a high quality material composed of a select combination of aggregates. The polymer concrete is ideal for the evacuation of fluids. The polymeric nature of this material allows smooth surfaces with very low friction on prefabricated elements, thereby facilitating the rapid run-off of fluids and also offering a water absorption index which is virtually non-existent. The mechanical properties of the material allows for the design of light and durable products. The drainage channels are manufactured according to Standard EN 1433 Drainage channels for vehicular and pedestrian areas - Classification, design and testing requirements, marking and evaluation of conformity\n",

      "Applicability: This average product EPD is for Moore Concretes precast concrete bunker wall. The results presented in this EPD are the results for a weighted average of the concrete mixes and steel reinforcement of the bunker wall products manufactured by Moore Concrete in 2021. The raw materials are cements, GGBS, aggregates, admixtures, reinforcing steel and lifting accessories. In addition, consumables include steel and timber for formwork, release agents and curing agents, plastic and concrete spacers. The products are manufactured in accordance with the following standards: EN 13369 Common rules for precast concrete products EN 15258 Precast concrete Products. Retaining wall elements. The precast units are delivered to site on flat-bed trucks. No product packaging is used in the delivery to the customer, other than re-useable wood skids, as and when needed. The precast products are manufactured from cement and cement replacements, aggregates, water and a variety of admixtures. The concrete mix ingredients are batch-weighed, mixed and dropped into a hopper that is transported across the factory hall so that the fresh concrete is then placed into the selected formwork/mould. The moulds are prepared with a mould oil, reinforcing bars and spacers before the mix is poured. Once the fresh concrete is placed in the moulds, the surface is sprayed with a curing agent to assist curing. The moulds are left in place on the factory floor to allow the concrete to cure. Demoulding of the precast concrete elements takes place once the correct strength has been achieved. Units are finished in the factory and transported to a storage area.\n",

BS EN 771:3:2011 Aggregate concrete masonry units (Dense and lightweight aggregates) BS EN 1340:2003 Concrete kerb units. Requirements and test methods. Products are manufactured in two parts - a facing mix, that is mixed seperately, and is then placed on top of a base mix. The facing mix is some 8mm thick, and this is placed on top of the base mix, which is of varying thickness, (depending on loading). The facing mix comprises special sands and pigments for appearance. The base mix comprises standard sands and cement, and does not have any pigments. The declared unit of this type of product is one m. Specialist sands are coloured white, grey, black, red and/or other as defined. Cements are either CEM II (general use), CEM I (for high strength) or CEM I white for appearance. The mean density of the hardened products is 2350 kg/m. Most of the sands and aggregates are sourced from Tobermores own quarries in the locality. Cements are locally sourced from within Northern Ireland. Some specialist sands come from quarries outside of Northern Ireland, within the EU. The finished products are then supplied to customers in bales, shrink-wrapped in polythene comprising 30 recycled plastic. Pallets are not included in the calculation. A1 Raw materials supply: The raw materials, sands, pigments, admixtures and cements are sourced from within the represntative geographic area. This module takes into account extraction and processing (including energies) of raw materials before delivery to Tobermore. A2 Transport: This module covers the impacts of the transport of the raw materials to the production site. A3 Manufacturing: The paving products are manufactured from specially selected sands, cement, water and a variety of admixtures. The ingredients are batch-weighed and mixed in a concrete pan mixer and dropped through a weigh hopper into moulds for setting. The wet mixes are placed in a curing chamber where the the paving products harden and set. After leaving the curing oven, the paving products are finished according to intended market. The finishing processes are: (a) tumbling in a rotating drum, (b) texturing by shot-blasting the facing surface, and (c) grinding of the facing surface with a carbide tipped grinding head. A proportion of the products do not go through any of the finishing processes. Some products are both textured and ground. After finishing, the paving products are shrink-wrapped and then stored onsite for onward delivery to the customers.\n",

BS EN 771:3:2011 Aggregate concrete masonry units (Dense and lightweight aggregates) BS EN 1340:2003 Concrete kerb units. Requirements and test methods. Products are manufactured in two parts - a facing mix, that is mixed seperately, and is then placed on top of a base mix. The facing mix is some 8mm thick, and this is placed on top of the base mix, which is of varying thickness, (depending on loading). The facing mix comprises special sands and pigments for appearance. The base mix comprises standard sands and cement, and does not have any pigments. The declared unit of this type of product is one m. Specialist sands are coloured white, grey, black, red and/or other as defined. Cements are either CEM II (general use), CEM I (for high strength) or CEM I white for appearance. The mean density of the hardened products is 2350 kg/m. Most of the sands and aggregates are sourced from Tobermores own quarries in the locality. Cements are locally sourced from within Northern Ireland. Some specialist sands come from quarries outside of Northern Ireland, within the EU. The finished products are then supplied to customers in bales, shrink-wrapped in polythene comprising 30 recycled plastic. Pallets are not included in the calculation. A1 Raw materials supply: The raw materials, sands, pigments, admixtures and cements are sourced from within the represntative geographic area. This module takes into account extraction and processing (including energies) of raw materials before delivery to Tobermore. A2 Transport: This module covers the impacts of the transport of the raw materials to the production site. A3 Manufacturing: The paving products are manufactured from specially selected sands, cement, water and a variety of admixtures. The ingredients are batch-weighed and mixed in a concrete pan mixer and dropped through a weigh hopper into moulds for setting. The wet mixes are placed in a curing chamber where the the paving products harden and set. After leaving the curing oven, the paving products are finished according to intended market. The finishing processes are: (a) tumbling in a rotating drum, (b) texturing by shot-blasting the facing surface, and (c) grinding of the facing surface with a carbide tipped grinding head. A proportion of the products do not go through any of the finishing processes. Some products are both textured and ground. After finishing, the paving products are shrink-wrapped and then stored onsite for onward delivery to the customers.\n",

The autoclaved aerated concrete blocks are covered by harmonised technical specification in EN 771-4. When producing autoclaved aerated concrete, aluminum powder or paste is added, which starts the mass rising process - a chemical reaction occurs between aluminum powder and calcium hydroxide. Autoclaved aerated concrete is used to build single-layer, multi-layer external and internal walls. It is produced, among others, in a version with tongue and groove profiling (vertical joint not filled with mortar). The list of products covered by this EPD is presented in Table no. 1.\n",

      "Classification: nan\n",
      "Applicability: The declaration covers various precast light concrete products based on expanded clay including types LC12/13 D1.4, LC16/18 D1.6, LC 16/18 D1.8, LC20/22 D1.8, LC20/22 D2.0, with densities range 1400-2100 kg/m3. Prefabricated concrete is a term that covers a wide group of ready-made building elements, joined together with other elements at the construction site. A common feature of all prefabricated elements is the ability to use them as ready-made modules from which larger structures are assembled. Prefabricated concrete elements resemble childrens blocks with various shapes that allow you to build even very complex structures. Expanded clay concrete is an innovative concrete mixture with expanded clay aggregate. Thanks to this, it is light (1400-2000 kg/m3) and has excellent thermal and acoustic insulation. Additionally, the material is highly fire-resistant and resistant to fungi, mold, pests (rodents and insects) and moisture. It is this last feature that makes expanded clay concrete particularly recommended for people struggling with allergies or respiratory diseases. Houses built from this material provide not only durability and energy efficiency, but also a healthy and comfortable living environment. The properties of expanded clay allow, through high thermal accumulation, to maintain optimal thermal comfort in the building regardless of the season - the house remains cool in summer and does not cool down too much in winter. Other advantages of expanded clay concrete include: - vapor permeability, - high compressive strength, - low heat transfer coefficient, - frost resistance, - easy mechanical processing (e.g. cutting to size). All additional technical information about the product is available on the manufacturers website and catalogues.\n",

      "Description: Baraclit prefabricated panels are available in different thicknesses (18, 25 or 30 cm), with characteristics of variable fire resistance in accordance with the UNI standard EN 1992-1-2:2005 and with different thermal performances calculated according to UNI EN ISO 10211:2008. Specifically, they are divided into three categories:  In solid concrete: for which it is not foreseen no internal insulation  Lightened: inside which there is a lightening in expanded polystyrene  KlimaWall series: with total thermal break insulation. In relation to the KlimaWall panels, the Plus and Max versions are also available, which present two thermal performance alternatives, through the possibility to vary the conductivity characteristic of the internal insulation polystyrene.\n",
      "Applicability: The infill panels constitute the walls of a building and, therefore, are the elements that define its external boundaries or divide its interior. From a construction perspective, the infill panels are made of vibrated reinforced concrete (c.a.v.) and are available in both vertical and horizontal versions, depending on the various architectural and aesthetic requirements.

The majority of liquid components are automatically transported from the storage silos to the liquid mixer. All materials are mixed at room temperature. Module A3 is divided into: 1. Manufacturing process 2. Packaging material that leaves the factory with the final product plastic packaging. 3. Production and disposal of wastes resulting from raw materials packaging. The chemicals are supplied to the factory in either Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBC) or plastic drums which are reused or sold. This step assumes a worst case scenario of no reuse and the plastic packaging is transported to a landfill for disposal.\n",
      "- Applicability: DURALATEX is a synthetic resin polymer which is supplied as a ready to use liquid. It is designed to improve the qualities of site-batched cementitious mortars and slurries. Being resistant to hydrolysis, it is ideal for internal and external applications in conjunction with cement. It improves adhesion of thin section cement patches, mortars and screeds to their substrates. DURACURE WBW is a concrete curing compound used to create a non-penetrating continuous film immediately upon contact with a cementious surface. It is a low viscosity, wax emulsion, water-based concrete-curing compound. It is applied to green concrete or fresh cementitious surfaces as a nonpenetrating film, which appears white after application but then dries to a clear film. It is used for curing of large concrete surface areas, such as airport aprons, concrete roads and bridge structures as well as all general applications. The film prevents excessive water evaporation which permits more efficient cement hydration.\n",

      "- Description: VSBs supply chain that is assessed extends from their suppliers of packaging materials, consumables, but above all from the supplier of screws in Taiwan, to VSBs operations in Brmhult for packaging and distribution. Hence, screw production in Taiwan falls under A1 Raw material. The screw is manufactured by a supplier with factory in Kaohsiung City in Taiwan. The raw material to the screw manufacturing is steel wire and production process includes drawing the wire, forging and treading into desired screw shape. Lastly the screw is heat treated for better mechanical strength and surface treated. Finished screw is transported by boat and truck (assumed to be freight lorry, 16-32t, EURO5, powered with diesel) to Vstsvensk Byggskruv were packaging and warehousing takes place. During Vstsvensk Byggskruvs operation, electricity and heat is used, and a small amount of production waste is created. Vstsvensk Byggskruv produces their own solar energy via solar panels on the roof, and the electricity been modelled with 14 solarenergy and 86 Swedish residual mix. This electricity mix has a climate impact (GWP-GHG) of 0,082 kg CO2 eq/kWh. The finished products are packaged in different packaging solutions before distributed to customer. The distribution transport (A4) is modelled with ruck, freight lorry 16-32t, EURO6, powered with diesel fuel, 249 km. After use the product is transported to waste processing and the steel is assumed to be recycled with an 86 collection and recovery. In the C module no environmental impact of deconstruction is assumed to occur (C1), as well as any environmental impact from recycling is not considered following the cut-off approach applied (C3). What is considered in the C module is the transportation to waste processing which is assumed to occur with truck 50km (C2), sorting and preparation of steel scrap for recycling (C3) were the 86 share is recycled, and disposal (landfill) of waste not sent for recycling (C4) which is 14 of the steel.\n",

      "- Applicability: This average product EPD is for Moore Concretes precast concrete bunker wall. The results presented in this EPD are the results for a weighted average of the concrete mixes and steel reinforcement of the bunker wall products manufactured by Moore Concrete in 2021. The raw materials are cements, GGBS, aggregates, admixtures, reinforcing steel and lifting accessories. In addition, consumables include steel and timber for formwork, release agents and curing agents, plastic and concrete spacers. The products are manufactured in accordance with the following standards: EN 13369 Common rules for precast concrete products EN 15258 Precast concrete Products. Retaining wall elements. The precast units are delivered to site on flat-bed trucks. No product packaging is used in the delivery to the customer, other than re-useable wood skids, as and when needed. The precast products are manufactured from cement and cement replacements, aggregates, water and a variety of admixtures. The concrete mix ingredients are batch-weighed, mixed and dropped into a hopper that is transported across the factory hall so that the fresh concrete is then placed into the selected formwork/mould. The moulds are prepared with a mould oil, reinforcing bars and spacers before the mix is poured. Once the fresh concrete is placed in the moulds, the surface is sprayed with a curing agent to assist curing. The moulds are left in place on the factory floor to allow the concrete to cure. Demoulding of the precast concrete elements takes place once the correct strength has been achieved. Units are finished in the factory and transported to a storage area.\n",

      "- Applicability: Tobermore concrete paving, walling and kerb products are made with sands, cements and pigments specially selected for their aesthetic and functional performance. They are manufactured in accordance with BS EN 1338 and BS EN 1339: Concrete Paving Blocks and Flags - Requirements and Test Methods. BS EN 771:3:2011 Aggregate concrete masonry units (Dense and lightweight aggregates) BS EN 1340:2003 Concrete kerb units. Requirements and test methods. Products are manufactured in two parts - a facing mix, that is mixed seperately, and is then placed on top of a base mix. The facing mix is some 8mm thick, and this is placed on top of the base mix, which is of varying thickness, (depending on loading). The facing mix comprises special sands and pigments for appearance. The base mix comprises standard sands and cement, and does not have any pigments. The declared unit of this type of product is one m. Specialist sands are coloured white, grey, black, red and/or other as defined. Cements are either CEM II (general use), CEM I (for high strength) or CEM I white for appearance. The mean density of the hardened products is 2350 kg/m. Most of the sands and aggregates are sourced from Tobermores own quarries in the locality. Cements are locally sourced from within Northern Ireland. Some specialist sands come from quarries outside of Northern Ireland, within the EU. The finished products are then supplied to customers in bales, shrink-wrapped in polythene comprising 30 recycled plastic. Pallets are not included in the calculation. A1 Raw materials supply: The raw materials, sands, pigments, admixtures and cements are sourced from within the represntative geographic area. This module takes into account extraction and processing (including energies) of raw materials before delivery to Tobermore. A2 Transport: This module covers the impacts of the transport of the raw materials to the production site. A3 Manufacturing: The paving products are manufactured from specially selected sands, cement, water and a variety of admixtures. The ingredients are batch-weighed and mixed in a concrete pan mixer and dropped through a weigh hopper into moulds for setting. The wet mixes are placed in a curing chamber where the the paving products harden and set. After leaving the curing oven, the paving products are finished according to intended market. The finishing processes are: (a) tumbling in a rotating drum, (b) texturing by shot-blasting the facing surface, and (c) grinding of the facing surface with a carbide tipped grinding head. A proportion of the products do not go through any of the finishing processes. Some products are both textured and ground. After finishing, the paving products are shrink-wrapped and then stored onsite for onward delivery to the customers.\n",

Products are manufactured in two parts - a facing mix, that is mixed seperately, and is then placed on top of a base mix. The facing mix is some 8mm thick, and this is placed on top of the base mix, which is of varying thickness, (depending on loading). The facing mix comprises special sands and pigments for appearance. The base mix comprises standard sands and cement, and does not have any pigments. The declared unit of this type of product is one m. Specialist sands are coloured white, grey, black, red and/or other as defined. Cements are either CEM II (general use), CEM I (for high strength) or CEM I white for appearance. The mean density of the hardened products is 2350 kg/m. Most of the sands and aggregates are sourced from Tobermores own quarries in the locality. Cements are locally sourced from within Northern Ireland. Some specialist sands come from quarries outside of Northern Ireland, within the EU. The finished products are then supplied to customers in bales, shrink-wrapped in polythene comprising 30 recycled plastic. Pallets are not included in the calculation. A1 Raw materials supply: The raw materials, sands, pigments, admixtures and cements are sourced from within the represntative geographic area. This module takes into account extraction and processing (including energies) of raw materials before delivery to Tobermore. A2 Transport: This module covers the impacts of the transport of the raw materials to the production site. A3 Manufacturing: The paving products are manufactured from specially selected sands, cement, water and a variety of admixtures. The ingredients are batch-weighed and mixed in a concrete pan mixer and dropped through a weigh hopper into moulds for setting. The wet mixes are placed in a curing chamber where the the paving products harden and set. After leaving the curing oven, the paving products are finished according to intended market. The finishing processes are: (a) tumbling in a rotating drum, (b) texturing by shot-blasting the facing surface, and (c) grinding of the facing surface with a carbide tipped grinding head. A proportion of the products do not go through any of the finishing processes. Some products are both textured and ground. After finishing, the paving products are shrink-wrapped and then stored onsite for onward delivery to the customers.\n",

      "- Applicability: HH produces autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) and sand-lime products and solutions primarily for walls in residential, industrial, and commercial construction. The main purpose of the autoclaved aerated concrete blocks is as building material for making walls. The autoclaved aerated concrete blocks are covered by harmonised technical specification in EN 771-4. When producing autoclaved aerated concrete, aluminum powder or paste is added, which starts the mass rising process - a chemical reaction occurs between aluminum powder and calcium hydroxide. Autoclaved aerated concrete is used to build single-layer, multi-layer external and internal walls. It is produced, among others, in a version with tongue and groove profiling (vertical joint not filled with mortar). The list of products covered by this EPD is presented in Table no. 1.\n",

      "- Product: Prefabricated products of expanded clay concrete\n",
      "- Applicability: The declaration covers various precast light concrete products based on expanded clay including types LC12/13 D1.4, LC16/18 D1.6, LC 16/18 D1.8, LC20/22 D1.8, LC20/22 D2.0, with densities range 1400-2100 kg/m3. Prefabricated concrete is a term that covers a wide group of ready-made building elements, joined together with other elements at the construction site. A common feature of all prefabricated elements is the ability to use them as ready-made modules from which larger structures are assembled. Prefabricated concrete elements resemble childrens blocks with various shapes that allow you to build even very complex structures. Expanded clay concrete is an innovative concrete mixture with expanded clay aggregate. Thanks to this, it is light (1400-2000 kg/m3) and has excellent thermal and acoustic insulation. Additionally, the material is highly fire-resistant and resistant to fungi, mold, pests (rodents and insects) and moisture. It is this last feature that makes expanded clay concrete particularly recommended for people struggling with allergies or respiratory diseases. Houses built from this material provide not only durability and energy efficiency, but also a healthy and comfortable living environment. The properties of expanded clay allow, through high thermal accumulation, to maintain optimal thermal comfort in the building regardless of the season - the house remains cool in summer and does not cool down too much in winter. Other advantages of expanded clay concrete include: - vapor permeability, - high compressive strength, - low heat transfer coefficient, - frost resistance, - easy mechanical processing (e.g. cutting to size). All additional technical information about the product is available on the manufacturers website and catalogues.\n",

      "Applicability: Concrete is a building material made up of several components, including cement, water, sand, gravel, and air. Ready-mixed concrete is manufactured in a batch plant in a controlled environment, using precise mix designs (with the addition of other cementitious materials or chemical admixtures that improve the properties of the concrete), ensuring consistency in quality, strength, and composition. This consistency leads to predictable performance in construction projects. Ready-mixed concrete is then delivered to the construction site in an unhardened state, ready to use, eliminating the need for on-site mixing. This saves time in labour, equipment setup, and material handling, speeding up the construction process. The product is produced according to BS 8500 and BS EN 206. Testing was conducted according to BS EN 12350 and BS EN 12390. Performance data of the product with respect to its characteristics in accordance with the relevant technical provision (no CE-marking). ?? Admixtures -Cement - Fibers - Natural aggregates - Sand - Water Mixing and blending UK average C28/35 CEM I Ready-mixed concrete The most common man-made substance in the world is concrete. Regardless of the magnitude of the construction, it is a necessary component of roads, buildings, bridges, dams, pavements, pipelines, sewers, and other structures. It is made up of naturally occurring aggregates with varying granulometries (sand, fine gravel, and gravel) joined by hydrated cement paste. To improve particular qualities of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability, durability, or early and final strength, chemical admixtures can also be used. After manufacture, concrete is workable enough to be transported, poured, pumped, put in place, and compacted at the project site, where it gradually solidifies and gains strength.

Foamit produseres i forskjellige tetthetsklasser som tilpasses krav og bruksområder. Foamit lages i vårt betongblandeverk og kjøres til byggeplass for pumping direkte til installasjonen – ikke nødvendig å lagre store mengder materialer på byggeplassen. Materialet er selvkomprimerende og selvnivellerende. Disse egenskapene gjør at store mengder Foamit legges ut på kort tid med et minimum av mannskap. Foamit er basert på LithoPore-teknologi utviklet av tyske Dr. Lucà and Partners. Den gir en stabil skumsement med tetthet på ca 300 kg/m3 uten bruk av polystyrenkuler. Foamit er et trygt alternativ og er klassifisert A1 – ikke brennbar. Tradisjonelt brukes dette materialet også til varmeisolajon, vegger uten bæring, takdekke og spesielle prosjekter som tunnelbygging og geotekniske applikasjoner. I et langsiktig miljøaspekt er Foamit et veldig godt alternativ, da det senere kan knuses og gjenvinnes, i motsetning til f.eks. isopor.\n",

De fungerer svært bra som yttervegger/fasader i alt fra eneboliger til kontorbygg og industribygg. De kan være både bærende og ikke­bærende og brukes i alle slags miljø og bære små til store laster. Yttersjiktet kan komme i ulike farger og mønster og kan være f.eks. glatt, slipt, frilagt eller med et 3D-mønster. I denne EPD­en er det tatt utgangspunkt i en fasade med glatt grått uttrykk, middels bæreevne og god isolasjonsevne. Elementene er produsert etter NS-EN 13369 og NS-EN 14992.

      "Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för håldäcksbjälklag inomhus. Det låga vct-talet på 0,40 medger hög hållfasthetsklass och en snabb uttorkning av konstruktionen.En torr inomhuskonstruktion i betong utsätts inte för några naturliga nedbrytningsmekanismer och har därför ingen begränsning i livslängd. Det medger också lågt behov av utbyten, underhåll och renovering under driftsfasen. Bärförmågan möjliggör stora spännvidder vilket medger flexibelt brukande av byggnaden under driftsfasen. Med betong uppfylls utan svårigheter en modern byggnads krav på ljudisolering, brandskydd och fuktsäkerhet. Betong är ett oorganiskt material som inte möglar eller tar skada av fukt. En av betongens viktiga egenskaper är värmelagringsförmågan som ger förutsättningar för låg energiförbrukning och effektuttag under byggnadens hela driftstid. Betong är återvinningsbart, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Se vidare på Betongföreningens hemsida om betongens egenskaper vid miljöcertifiering (se länk nedan).\n",

      "Applicability: Hollow core is a type of slab that is made of concrete and contains prestressed reinforcement. The elements have longitudinal air channels to optimize material use and load-bearing capacity. The hollow cores are manufactured in different thicknesses depending on the desired function. This type of slabs allows for large spans, which also provides good conditions for a flexible use of the building over its lifetime. It is also a very resource-efficient product that utilizes the included material optimally. The low w/c ratio and the high strength mean that the construction dries out quickly. With hollow core slabs, the building also receives very good properties in terms of sound insulation and good resistance against fire and moisture. Another of the concrete's important properties is its ability to store heat, which enables a low energy consumption and a lower power output during the building's entire operating time. Hollow cores are 100% recyclable and enable fast, cost-effective and rational assembly in the construction project. This type of slab is also well suited for reuse.\n",

Betongkvalitet: B45M40 Karbonklasse: Lavkarbon A (NB publikasjon nr 37 \"Lavkarbonbetong\") Brannklasse: Opptil REI180 Teoretisk nedbøyning etter lang tid kan bli opptil 70mm i ekstreme tilfelle, men typiske verdiar er opptil 20mm. I praksis er det ofte mindre. Svært gode muligheiter for utsparingar. Kanalane kan brukast som føring for ledning og røyr. Leveres som 210, 265, 285, 320, 340, 400, 420 og 500 profil.

      "Applicability: Hulldekke er eit dekkeelement som fungerer ypperlig som etasjeskille og tak. Dei kan vere over 20m lange og kappast på langs og på tvers og kan dermed brukast i alle slags bygg. Utsparingar til f.eks ventilasjon og vatn og avløp lar seg også lett gjennomføre og hulldekke er dermed eit godt valg for å få til eit godt samarbeid med andre fag. Utkraging er også mulig. Denne EPD­en er basert på ein snittverdi av alle våre miljøprofilar frå 210mm til 500mm tjukk. Antal wire er satt til 9,33 som er snittverdien brukt i 2018 Hulldekke er spennarmert med alt i frå 4 til 21 wire som er laga av minimum 95% resirkulert stål. Typisk oppspenning er 10 tonn. Betongen som er brukt er ein svært sterk betong med kortreist knust granitt­tilslag frå 0­22mm og rein Miljøsement frå Cemex. Hulldekka har hule kanalar som utgjer frå 40% til 55% av tverrsnittet. 1m2 med hulldekke krever dermed mykje mindre betong enn 1m2 med kompakt dekke.\n",

      "Applicability: Isolerte fasadeelementer er bygget opp av et innersjikt av betong, et isolasjonssjikt og et yttersjikt av betong som er støpt sammen. De fungerer svært bra som yttervegger/fasader i alt fra eneboliger til kontorbygg og industribygg. De kan være både bærende og ikke­-bærende, og brukes i alle slags miljø og bære små til store laster. I denne EPD­en er det tatt utgangspunkt i en fasade med glatt grått uttrykk, middels bæreevne og god isolasjonsevne. Det kan benyttes ulike typer isolasjon. Yttersjikt og innersjikt er bundet i sammen med sjiktforbindere i stål. Yttersjiktet kan komme i ulike farger og mønster og kan være f.eks. glatt, slipt, frilagt eller med et 3D-mønster. Denne EPD­ tar utgangspunkt i at det ikke er armert søyle­- eller bjelkesoner i innersjiktet. Isolasjonen i denne EPD er EPS.\n",

Betong är återvinningsbar, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Fabriksbetongen levereras till byggarbetsplatsen med betongbil och används till gjutning av armerade betongkonstruktioner Armerad betong i exponeringsklass XC1, XC2, XC3, XC4 utsätts för armeringskorrosion föranledd av karbonatisering. Betong i exponeringsklass XD3 utsätts för klorider i from av tösalter som orsakar armeringskorrosion. Karbonatisering minskar betongens pH-värde från ytan och in i betongen och bryter på sikt ner passivisering av armeringsstålet som skyddar stålet mot korrosion. Livslängden på en betongkonstruktion beror förutom på betongkvaliteten även på tjockleken på det täckande betongskiktet. Livslängden för huskonstruktioner är normal 100 respektive 50 år, beroende på konstruktionsdel.\n",

      "Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för förspända massiva bjälklag inomhus. EPD’n avser prefabricerad förspända massiva bjälklag tillverkad vid Strängbetongs anläggning i Kungsör. Det medger också lågt behov av utbyten, underhåll och renovering under driftsfasen. Bärförmågan möjliggör stora spännvidder vilket medger flexibelt brukande av byggnaden under driftsfasen. Med betong uppfylls utan svårigheter en modern byggnads krav på ljudisolering, brandskydd och fuktsäkerhet. Betong är ett oorganiskt material som inte möglar eller tar skada av fukt. En av betongens viktiga egenskaper är värmelagringsförmågan som ger förutsättningar för låg energiförbrukning och effektuttag under byggnadens hela driftstid. Betong är återvinningsbart, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Se vidare på Betongföreningens hemsida om betongens egenskaper vid miljöcertifiering (se länk nedan).\n",

      "Applicability: EPD:n är beräknad för prefabricerad förspänd platta DF23 (230 mm tjock) med 0,9 vikt-% armering. Den är även gällande för armeringsmängderna mellan 0,7 och 2,3 vikt-% för både DF23 och DF22. DF används som bjälklag i byggnader. Betong för gjutning av produkten produceras på samma fabrik som tillverkar elementen. En prefabricerad inomhuskonstruktion i betong utsätts inte för några naturliga nedbrytningsmekanismer och har därför ingen begränsning i livslängd. Det medger också lågt behov av utbyten, underhåll och renovering under driftsfasen. Med prefabricerad betong uppfylls utan svårigheter en modern byggnads krav på ljudisolering, brandskydd och fuktsäkerhet. En av betongens viktiga egenskaper är värmelagringsförmågan som ger förutsättningar för låg energiförbrukning och effektuttag under byggnadens hela driftstid. Betong är återvinningsbart för att tillverka ny betong av eller som fyllnadsmaterial. Betong återtar CO2 under användnings och slutskedet genom karbonatiserings-processen (cement omvandlas tillbaka till kalk). Denna positiva miljöeffekt är inte medtagen i denna deklaration.

      "Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för sandwichvägg. Betong för sandwichväggar produceras inom samma fabrik som tillverkar prefabricerade sandwichväggar. Väggens innerskiva är en torr inomhuskonstruktion och utsätts inte för några naturliga nedbrytningsmekanismer och har därför ingen begränsning i livslängd. Ytterskivan kan utsättas för fukt och frost. Vald betongkvalitet och täckande betongskikt uppfyller gällande betongstandarder och säkerställer lång livslängd (100 år med 30 mm täckande betongskikt) med lågt behov av utbyten, underhåll och renovering under driftsfasen. Med betong uppfylls utan svårigheter en modern byggnads krav på ljudisolering, brandskydd och fuktsäkerhet. Betong är ett oorganiskt material som inte möglar eller tar skada av fukt. En av betongens viktiga egenskaper är värmelagringsförmågan som ger förutsättningar för låg energiförbrukning och effektuttag under byggnadens hela driftstid. Betong är återvinningsbart, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Se vidare på Betongföreningens hemsida om betongens egenskaper vid miljöcertifiering, se länk nedan.\n",

Da arbejdstilsynet stiller større og større krav til tunge løft, har vi udviklet en blok som skal håndteres med kran. For at dette ikke skal gå ud over arbejdstiden, har blokken en størrelse som gør, at man i stedet for, at sætte 6 alm. termblokke, kan sætte én Skawblock/Radonblock. Blokkens unikke \"L\"-Form betyder at gulvbetonen støbes helt op imod flamingoen, på den måde undgås den ekstra arbejdsgang med kantisolering. Dette er med andre ord en blok, som både skåner medarbejderne og samtidig giver en væsentlig besparelse på arbejdstiden. Blokkens størrelse og form kombineret med den grå grafit-isolering, giver et rigtig godt linjetab for fundamentet. Produktet er sammensat af Leca-vanger, med isolering mellem vangerne.\n",

Ved enhver leverance fra Spæncom leveres data på tons og m² elementer leveret. For omregning af miljøindikatorer til pr. m² massiv væg uden udsparinger, kan følgende omregningsfaktorer bruges for følgende tykkelser: Omregningsfaktor 120 mm væg 295 kg/m²: 0,30 Omregningsfaktor 150 mm væg 365 kg/m²: 0,36 Omregningsfaktor 180 mm væg 434 kg/m²: 0,43 Omregningsfaktor 200 mm væg 480 kg/m²: 0,48 Omregningsfaktor 250 mm væg 595 kg/m²: 0,60 Omregningsfaktor 300 mm væg 711 kg/m²: 0,71 Vi gør opmærksom på, at brugen af omregningsfaktorer også medfører en reduktion i mængden af armering, hvilket muligvis ikke afspejler den korrekte mængde, som bør anvendes i den pågældende LCA beregning. Hvis denne EPD skal benyttes for et scenarie med mindre afvigelser for armering eller betontype, kan I kontakte Spæncoms bæredygtighedsafdeling på: baeredygtighed@spaencom.dk, for at sikre, at EPD'en kan anvendes til den pågældende LCA beregning. Armeringsmængden er beregnet ud fra det gennemsnitlige armeringsforbrug for vægge produceret hos Spæncom Kolding i 2023. Sammensætningen, der anvendes til denne EPD, er beregnet ud fra gennemsnitlige årsdata for råmaterialer. Elementet har et samlet klimaaftryk på 145,5 kg CO2e/ton iht. bygnignsreglements LCA krav.

      "Description: Veidekke Prefab sine trapper og repo er produsert etter NS-EN 13369 og NS-EN 14992. Betongen er produsert etter NS-EN 206+NA. Karbonklasse: Lavkarbon Pluss (NB Publikasjon nr. 37 \"Lavkarbonbetong\") Resirkulert kamstålarmering: B500NC\n",
      "Applicability: Trapper kan bli levert med de dimensjonene som måtte være ønskelig. De kan leveres med repo både i topp og i bunn, og brukes både inne og ute. Betongkvaliteten kan være alt fra M90 til MF40. Betongtrapper kan dermed bli brukt til alle typer prosjekt, i alle typer bygg og overalt i bygget. Denne EPD-en er basert på en innendørstrapp med Lavkarbon Pluss, betongkvalitet B35M60. Elementene er laget av en betong med kortreist knust granittilslag fra 0-16mm, miljøsement og CEM III/B fra Schwenk. Våre trapper og repo er armert med slakkarmering laget av resirkulert skrapjern. Armeringen består ofte av stangarmering fra 12mm - 20mm og bøylearmering fra 8mm - 10mm. Diverse innstøpingsgods som spirorør, heiseanker og stålplater for å binde elementene sammen er også innstøpt. Trappene kan bli støpt med antiskli-funksjon, slipte trappetrinn, integrert lys, vaskekant og andre overflater som er ønsket. All restbetong i vår produksjon av trapper og repo blir brukt til produksjon av Lego- og Jerseyklosser som videre går ut til våre kunder.\n",

      "Applicability: Concrete is a building material made up of several components, including cement, water, sand, gravel, and air. Ready-mixed concrete is manufactured in a batch plant in a controlled environment, using precise mix designs (with the addition of other cementitious materials or chemical admixtures that improve the properties of the concrete), ensuring consistency in quality, strength, and composition. This consistency leads to predictable performance in construction projects. Ready-mixed concrete is then delivered to the construction site in an unhardened state, ready to use, eliminating the need for on-site mixing.

Regardless of the magnitude of the construction, it is a necessary component of roads, buildings, bridges, dams, pavements, pipelines, sewers, and other structures. It is made up of naturally occurring aggregates with varying granulometries (sand, fine gravel, and gravel) joined by hydrated cement paste. To improve particular qualities of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability, durability, or early and final strength, chemical admixtures can also be used. After manufacture, concrete is workable enough to be transported, poured, pumped, put in place, and compacted at the project site, where it gradually solidifies and gains strength.

      "Applicability: Concrete is a building material made up of several components, including cement, water, sand, gravel, and air. Ready-mixed concrete is manufactured in a batch plant in a controlled environment, using precise mix designs (with the addition of other cementitious materials or chemical admixtures that improve the properties of the concrete), ensuring consistency in quality, strength, and composition. This consistency leads to predictable performance in construction projects. Ready-mixed concrete is then delivered to the construction site in an unhardened state, ready to use, eliminating the need for on-site mixing. This saves time in labour, equipment setup, and material handling, speeding up the construction process. The product is produced according to BS 8500 and BS EN 206. Testing was conducted according to BS EN 12350 and BS EN 12390. Performance data of the product with respect to its characteristics in accordance with the relevant technical provision (no CE-marking). The most common man-made substance in the world is concrete. Regardless of the magnitude of the construction, it is a necessary component of roads, buildings, bridges, dams, pavements, pipelines, sewers, and other structures. It is made up of naturally occurring aggregates with varying granulometries (sand, fine gravel, and gravel) joined by hydrated cement paste. To improve particular qualities of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability, durability, or early and final strength, chemical admixtures can also be used. After manufacture, concrete is workable enough to be transported, poured, pumped, put in place, and compacted at the project site, where it gradually solidifies and gains strength.

The walls are cast on horizontal mold tables with one side that is counter-moulded and with one side that is machined, up in form. Walls are manufactured in different thicknesses depending on the desired function. With concrete walls, very good properties are obtained in terms of sound insulation, fire resistance and moisture safety. Another of concrete's important properties is its ability to store heat, which enables low energy consumption and a lower power usage during the building's entire operating life. Concrete walls are 100% recyclable and enable fast, cost-effective and rational progress in the construction project.\n",

      "Applicability: Concrete is a building material made up of several components, including cement, water, sand, gravel, and air. Ready-mix concrete is manufactured in a batch plant in a controlled environment, using precise mix designs (with the addition of other cementitious materials or chemical admixtures that improve the properties of the concrete), ensuring consistency in quality, strength, and composition. This consistency leads to predictable performance in construction projects. Ready-mix concrete is then delivered to the construction site in an unhardened state, ready to use, eliminating the need for on-site mixing. This saves time in labor, equipment setup, and material handling, speeding up the construction process. The product is produced according to DIN EN 206. Testing was conducted according to EN 12350 and EN 12390. Performance data of the product with respect to its characteristics in accordance with the relevant technical provision (no CE-marking). The most common man-made substance in the world is concrete. Regardless of the magnitude of the construction, it is a necessary component of roads, buildings, bridges, dams, pavements, pipelines, sewers, and other structures. It is made up of naturally occurring aggregates with varying granulometries (sand, fine gravel, and gravel) joined by hydrated cement paste. To improve particular qualities of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability, durability, or early and final strength, chemical admixtures can also be used. After manufacture, concrete is workable enough to be transported, poured, pumped, put in place, and compacted at the project site, where it gradually solidifies and gains strength.

En av betongens viktiga egenskaper är värmelagringsförmågan som ger förutsättningar för låg energiförbrukning och effektuttag under byggnadens hela driftstid. Betong är återvinningsbart, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Se vidare på Betongföreningens hemsida om betongens egenskaper vid miljöcertifiering (se länk nedan).\n",

Betongens livslängd i vägmiljö eller marin miljö (Exponerinsklasserna XS3 och XD3) begränsas främst av salter som orsakar armeringskorrosion. Betongens täckande betongskikt över armeringen ska dimensioneras för att förhindra korrosion. Normal teknisk livslängd (den tid under vilket byggnadsverket uppfyller avsedd funktion med \"normalt underhåll\") för en konstbyggnad är minst 120 år. För ökad livslängd kan till exempel beständigare armering eller impregnering väljas. Exponeringsklassen XF4 gäller för betongkonstruktioner som utsätts för frost i kombination med tösalter/vatten och/eller havsvatten. Normal teknisk livslängd för en konstbyggnad är minst 120 år.

      "Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för Terrazzo betongtrappor. Det låga vct-talet på 0,55 medger hög hållfasthetsklass och en snabb uttorkning av konstruktionen. På Strängbetong gjuts trappor i två produktionssteg, först sker steggjutning därefter trappgjutning i form där de förtillverkade stegen utgör formbotten. Därpå armeras konstruktionen och detaljer som lyft och räckesfästen monteras i form. Efter det så sker gjutning med konstruktionsbetong. När gjutning är klar så vaxas den färdiga ytan och trappan kläs med fibertexduk som utgör skydd under både lagring, transport och byggperiod. Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från Strängbetongs trapptillverkande enheter i Sverige, Norberg och Herrljunga. Betongreceptet är ett standardrecept för den betongkvalitet som används för trappor inomhus. Trappans plan och sättsteg är utförda i slipad Terrazzo och beräknat med ett vanligt förekommande recept. Det i EPD’n specificerade betongreceptet är en proportionell sammanvägning av dessa. Inventeringen har utgått från en typ produkt, vilket är en rak 900 mm bred tvåloppstrappa med tillhörande vilplan om ca 1,9 m², i terrazzoutförande. Typ produkten väger 3101 kg och levereras färdig, vaxad och skyddstäckt från fabrik. Dock är trappräcken inte inkluderade i beräkningen.\n",

Inntaket leveres valgfritt med primet rist. Det anbefales at rist benyttes både for kvistfang og som sikkerhetssperre. Risten leveres med en meget enkel løfteanordning som sikrer en enkel demontering ved rengjøring og inspisering. BS-Bekkeinntak leveres i 3 typer som dekker dimensjonsområdet DN 300 - 1600mm.

      "Classification: Bygg / Ferdig betong\n",
      "PCR: NPCR Part A: Construction products and services. Ver. 1.0. April 2017\n",
      "Description: CG er 100% genanvendeligt.\n",
      "Applicability: Cementstabiliseret grus- bærelag for fugefrit Confalt industrigulv. CG Valsebeton anvendes som bærelag for vores Confalt SFB belægninger til alle typer af industri- og lagerhaller. Opbygningen kan i mange tilfælde være et alternativ til armerede betongulve. CG Valsebeton udlægges umiddelbart efter fundamenterne er støbt og skaber et stabilt, plant og vedligeholdesfrit underlag i byggeperioden, hvor der kan køres med mobilkraner, lifte og andet materiel til den efterfølgende byggeproces. CG Valsebeton kan også med store økonomiske og praktiske fordele anvendes til fastgørelse af skråstivere til montage af betonelementer. CG Valsebeton udlægges direkte ovenpå stabilgrus eller på hård isolering. Opbygningen tilpasses kundens forskellige behov og krav, noget der alene opnås gennem personlig rådgivning og individuelle løsninger. Blanding CG Valsebeton består af udvalgte kvalitetsbindemidler, herunder special kornkurve af støbemix tilsat cement. CG Valsebeton blandes på eget mobilt betonblandeanlæg eller købes direkte ved betonproducent. Udlægning For at opnå de bedste resultater for jævnhed, anvender vi den nyeste laserteknologi til vores specielle udlæggermaskiner. Et arbejdsteam kan udlægge 2-3000 m2 færdig CG pr. dag. CG Valsebeton udlægges i tykkelser fra 130 mm afhængig af belastning. Belastning Fladelast 200 KN/m2 Vores samlede opbygning med CG Valsebeton og Confalt kan klare belastninger på op til 100 KN på reolben som er 0,12 x 0,12 m. Trækstyrke i CG Valsebeton ved montage af elementstøtter er typisk 20-30 KN Dimensionering af gulvet udføres individuelt fra projekt til projekt. Arbejdstemperatur Frostfrit.\n",

      "- Applicability: Concrete is a building material made up of several components, including cement, water, sand, gravel, and air. Ready-mixed concrete is manufactured in a batch plant in a controlled environment, using precise mix designs (with the addition of other cementitious materials or chemical admixtures that improve the properties of the concrete), ensuring consistency in quality, strength, and composition. This consistency leads to predictable performance in construction projects. Ready-mixed concrete is then delivered to the construction site in an unhardened state, ready to use, eliminating the need for on-site mixing. This saves time in labour, equipment setup, and material handling, speeding up the construction process. The product is produced according to BS 8500 and BS EN 206. Testing was conducted according to BS EN 12350 and BS EN 12390. Performance data of the product with respect to its characteristics in accordance with the relevant technical provision (no CE-marking). ?? Admixtures -Cement - Fibers - Natural aggregates - Sand - Water Mixing and blending UK average C28/35 CEM I Ready-mixed concrete The most common man-made substance in the world is concrete. Regardless of the magnitude of the construction, it is a necessary component of roads, buildings, bridges, dams, pavements, pipelines, sewers, and other structures. It is made up of naturally occurring aggregates with varying granulometries (sand, fine gravel, and gravel) joined by hydrated cement paste. To improve particular qualities of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability, durability, or early and final strength, chemical admixtures can also be used. After manufacture, concrete is workable enough to be transported, poured, pumped, put in place, and compacted at the project site, where it gradually solidifies and gains strength.

Produktet er flytende og det er viktig at alle hull tettes for å hindre uønsket lekkasje. Velde kan bidra med råd og hjelp.\n",
      "- Applicability: -Fabrikkblandet Skumbetong produsert i henhold til NS-EN 206. -Bruksområder: Tradisjonelt brukes dette materialet også til varmeisolajon, vegger uten bæring, takdekke og spesielle prosjekter som tunnelbygging og geotekniske applikasjoner. -Fabrikkblandet skumbetong produsert i henhold til NS-EN 206. Foamit produseres i forskjellige tetthetsklasser som tilpasses krav og bruksområder. Foamit lages i vårt betongblandeverk og kjøres til byggeplass for pumping direkte til installasjonen – ikke nødvendig å lagre store mengder materialer på byggeplassen. Materialet er selvkomprimerende og selvnivellerende. Disse egenskapene gjør at store mengder Foamit legges ut på kort tid med et minimum av mannskap. Foamit er basert på LithoPore-teknologi utviklet av tyske Dr. Lucà and Partners. Den gir en stabil skumsement med tetthet på ca 300 kg/m3 uten bruk av polystyrenkuler. Foamit er et trygt alternativ og er klassifisert A1 – ikke brennbar. Tradisjonelt brukes dette materialet også til varmeisolajon, vegger uten bæring, takdekke og spesielle prosjekter som tunnelbygging og geotekniske applikasjoner. I et langsiktig miljøaspekt er Foamit et veldig godt alternativ, da det senere kan knuses og gjenvinnes, i motsetning til f.eks. isopor.\n",

      "- Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för håldäcksbjälklag inomhus. Det låga vct-talet på 0,40 medger hög hållfasthetsklass och en snabb uttorkning av konstruktionen.En torr inomhuskonstruktion i betong utsätts inte för några naturliga nedbrytningsmekanismer och har därför ingen begränsning i livslängd. Det medger också lågt behov av utbyten, underhåll och renovering under driftsfasen. Bärförmågan möjliggör stora spännvidder vilket medger flexibelt brukande av byggnaden under driftsfasen. Med betong uppfylls utan svårigheter en modern byggnads krav på ljudisolering, brandskydd och fuktsäkerhet. Betong är ett oorganiskt material som inte möglar eller tar skada av fukt. En av betongens viktiga egenskaper är värmelagringsförmågan som ger förutsättningar för låg energiförbrukning och effektuttag under byggnadens hela driftstid. Betong är återvinningsbart, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Se vidare på Betongföreningens hemsida om betongens egenskaper vid miljöcertifiering (se länk nedan).\n",

      "- Applicability: Hollow core is a type of slab that is made of concrete and contains prestressed reinforcement. The elements have longitudinal air channels to optimize material use and load-bearing capacity. The hollow cores are manufactured in different thicknesses depending on the desired function. This type of slabs allows for large spans, which also provides good conditions for a flexible use of the building over its lifetime. It is also a very resource-efficient product that utilizes the included material optimally. The low w/c ratio and the high strength mean that the construction dries out quickly. With hollow core slabs, the building also receives very good properties in terms of sound insulation and good resistance against fire and moisture. Another of the concrete's important properties is its ability to store heat, which enables a low energy consumption and a lower power output during the building's entire operating time. Hollow cores are 100% recyclable and enable fast, cost-effective and rational assembly in the construction project. This type of slab is also well suited for reuse.\n",

Det er gode muligheter til å benytte lange spenn i bygningene, noe som reduserer antallet søyler i etasjene. Dette skaper åpne og fleksible områder i bygg, og gir rikelig med plass for kreativ utforming. Hulldekke er spennarmert med alt fra 4-21 wire som er laget av 95% resirkulert stål. Typisk oppspenning er 100-120 kN pr wire. Antall wire varierer avhengig av tykkelse på dekket, spennvidde og belastninger. Betongen som er brukt er produsert med kortreist, knust granitt-tilslag fra 0-22mm, Miljøsement og CEM III/B.\n",

      "- Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för betongväggar. EPD’n avser prefabricerad enkelskivig isolerade betongvägg tillverkad vid Strängbetongs anläggning i Örebro. Enkelskivig betongvägg, utförs normalt med gråbetong utan ur hållbarhetssynpunkt speciell ytbehandling. De faktorer som ger skillnader i utsläpp är mängden armering och detaljer i produkten samt hållfasthets och exponeringsklass för betongen. Större delen av volymen för produkten är placerade i mindre utsatta platser och därmed lägre exponeringsklasser.\n",

      "- Applicability: Isolerte fasadeelementer er bygget opp av et innersjikt av betong, et isolasjonssjikt og et yttersjikt av betong som er støpt sammen. De fungerer svært bra som yttervegger/fasader i alt fra eneboliger til kontorbygg og industribygg. De kan være både bærende og ikke­-bærende, og brukes i alle slags miljø og bære små til store laster. I denne EPD­en er det tatt utgangspunkt i en fasade med glatt grått uttrykk, middels bæreevne og god isolasjonsevne. Det kan benyttes ulike typer isolasjon. Yttersjikt og innersjikt er bundet i sammen med sjiktforbindere i stål. Yttersjiktet kan komme i ulike farger og mønster og kan være f.eks. glatt, slipt, frilagt eller med et 3D-mønster. Denne EPD­ tar utgangspunkt i at det ikke er armert søyle­- eller bjelkesoner i innersjiktet. Isolasjonen i denne EPD er EPS.\n",

Mängden cement kan variera med max +10% av vad som anges under produktinnehåll. Bindemedlet är bindemedelskombinationen BK II/B-M som består av Bascement eller motsvarande och GGBFS (Ground granulated blast-furnace slag)\n",
      "- Applicability: Fabriksbetong levererad av Sydsten är processcertifierad och uppfyller kraven i europeisk standard EN 206, svensk tillämpningsstandard SS 137003 samt AMA Anläggning. Betong är återvinningsbar, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Fabriksbetongen levereras till byggarbetsplatsen med betongbil och används till gjutning av armerade betongkonstruktioner Armerad betong i exponeringsklass XC1, XC2, XC3, XC4 utsätts för armeringskorrosion föranledd av karbonatisering. Betong i exponeringsklass XD3 utsätts för klorider i from av tösalter som orsakar armeringskorrosion. Karbonatisering minskar betongens pH-värde från ytan och in i betongen och bryter på sikt ner passivisering av armeringsstålet som skyddar stålet mot korrosion. Livslängden på en betongkonstruktion beror förutom på betongkvaliteten även på tjockleken på det täckande betongskiktet. Livslängden för huskonstruktioner är normal 100 respektive 50 år, beroende på konstruktionsdel.\n",

Kompaktelementene er armert med slakkarmering som er laget av resirkulert skrapjern. Armeringen består ofte av stangarmering (12mm-20mm) og bøylearmering (8-10mm). Innstøpningsgods som spirorør, stålplater og heiseanker blir støpt inn for å kunne binde elementene sammen, og for at de skal kunne fraktes. Elementene kan bli behandlet og få et hav av ulike overflater og uttrykk. Våre kompakte veggelementer er med på å skape en stabil innetemperatur gjennom døgnet og har god brannmotstand.

      "- Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för förspända massiva bjälklag inomhus. EPD’n avser prefabricerad förspända massiva bjälklag tillverkad vid Strängbetongs anläggning i Kungsör. Det medger också lågt behov av utbyten, underhåll och renovering under driftsfasen. Bärförmågan möjliggör stora spännvidder vilket medger flexibelt brukande av byggnaden under driftsfasen. Med betong uppfylls utan svårigheter en modern byggnads krav på ljudisolering, brandskydd och fuktsäkerhet. Betong är ett oorganiskt material som inte möglar eller tar skada av fukt. En av betongens viktiga egenskaper är värmelagringsförmågan som ger förutsättningar för låg energiförbrukning och effektuttag under byggnadens hela driftstid. Betong är återvinningsbart, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Se vidare på Betongföreningens hemsida om betongens egenskaper vid miljöcertifiering (se länk nedan).\n",

      "- Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för sandwichvägg. Betong för sandwichväggar produceras inom samma fabrik som tillverkar prefabricerade sandwichväggar. Väggens innerskiva är en torr inomhuskonstruktion och utsätts inte för några naturliga nedbrytningsmekanismer och har därför ingen begränsning i livslängd. Ytterskivan kan utsättas för fukt och frost. Vald betongkvalitet och täckande betongskikt uppfyller gällande betongstandarder och säkerställer lång livslängd (100 år med 30 mm täckande betongskikt) med lågt behov av utbyten, underhåll och renovering under driftsfasen. Med betong uppfylls utan svårigheter en modern byggnads krav på ljudisolering, brandskydd och fuktsäkerhet. Betong är ett oorganiskt material som inte möglar eller tar skada av fukt. En av betongens viktiga egenskaper är värmelagringsförmågan som ger förutsättningar för låg energiförbrukning och effektuttag under byggnadens hela driftstid. Betong är återvinningsbart, vanligtvis som fyllnadsmaterial. Se vidare på Betongföreningens hemsida om betongens egenskaper vid miljöcertifiering, se länk nedan.\n",

Betongkvaliteten kan være alt fra M90 til MF40. Betongtrapper kan dermed bli brukt til alle typer prosjekt, i alle typer bygg og overalt i bygget. Denne EPD-en er basert på en innendørstrapp med Lavkarbon Pluss, betongkvalitet B35M60. Elementene er laget av en betong med kortreist knust granittilslag fra 0-16mm, miljøsement og CEM III/B fra Schwenk. Våre trapper og repo er armert med slakkarmering laget av resirkulert skrapjern. Armeringen består ofte av stangarmering fra 12mm - 20mm og bøylearmering fra 8mm - 10mm. Diverse innstøpingsgods som spirorør, heiseanker og stålplater for å binde elementene sammen er også innstøpt. Trappene kan bli støpt med antiskli-funksjon, slipte trappetrinn, integrert lys, vaskekant og andre overflater som er ønsket. All restbetong i vår produksjon av trapper og repo blir brukt til produksjon av Lego- og Jerseyklosser som videre går ut til våre kunder.\n",

      "- Applicability: Concrete is a building material made up of several components, including cement, water, sand, gravel, and air. Ready-mix concrete is manufactured in a batch plant in a controlled environment, using precise mix designs (with the addition of other cementitious materials or chemical admixtures that improve the properties of the concrete), ensuring consistency in quality, strength, and composition. This consistency leads to predictable performance in construction projects. Ready-mix concrete is then delivered to the construction site in an unhardened state, ready to use, eliminating the need for on-site mixing. This saves time in labor, equipment setup, and material handling, speeding up the construction process. The product is produced according to DIN EN 206. Testing was conducted according to EN 12350 and EN 12390. Performance data of the product with respect to its characteristics in accordance with the relevant technical provision (no CE-marking). The most common man-made substance in the world is concrete. Regardless of the magnitude of the construction, it is a necessary component of roads, buildings, bridges, dams, pavements, pipelines, sewers, and other structures. It is made up of naturally occurring aggregates with varying granulometries (sand, fine gravel, and gravel) joined by hydrated cement paste. To improve particular qualities of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability, durability, or early and final strength, chemical admixtures can also be used. After manufacture, concrete is workable enough to be transported, poured, pumped, put in place, and compacted at the project site, where it gradually solidifies and gains strength.

Livslängd bestäms av täckande betongskikt. Normal livslängd för byggnadsverksdelar är antingen 50 eller 100 år beroende på byggnadsverksdelens åtkomst för inspektion och reparation. Betongens livslängd i vägmiljö eller marin miljö (Exponerinsklasserna XS3 och XD3) begränsas främst av salter som orsakar armeringskorrosion. Betongens täckande betongskikt över armeringen ska dimensioneras för att förhindra korrosion. Normal teknisk livslängd (den tid under vilket byggnadsverket uppfyller avsedd funktion med \"normalt underhåll\") för en konstbyggnad är minst 120 år. För ökad livslängd kan till exempel beständigare armering eller impregnering väljas. Exponeringsklassen XF4 gäller för betongkonstruktioner som utsätts för frost i kombination med tösalter/vatten och/eller havsvatten. Normal teknisk livslängd för en konstbyggnad är minst 120 år. För ökad livslängd kan till exempel beständigare armering eller impregnering väljas.\n",

      "- Applicability: Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från tillverkare inom Strängbetong i Sverige. Betongreceptet är ett exempel på en betongkvalitet som används för Terrazzo betongtrappor. Det låga vct-talet på 0,55 medger hög hållfasthetsklass och en snabb uttorkning av konstruktionen. På Strängbetong gjuts trappor i två produktionssteg, först sker steggjutning därefter trappgjutning i form där de förtillverkade stegen utgör formbotten. Därpå armeras konstruktionen och detaljer som lyft och räckesfästen monteras i form. Efter det så sker gjutning med konstruktionsbetong. När gjutning är klar så vaxas den färdiga ytan och trappan kläs med fibertexduk som utgör skydd under både lagring, transport och byggperiod. Inventeringen baseras på uppgifter från Strängbetongs trapptillverkande enheter i Sverige, Norberg och Herrljunga. Betongreceptet är ett standardrecept för den betongkvalitet som används för trappor inomhus. Trappans plan och sättsteg är utförda i slipad Terrazzo och beräknat med ett vanligt förekommande recept. Det i EPD’n specificerade betongreceptet är en proportionell sammanvägning av dessa. Inventeringen har utgått från en typ produkt, vilket är en rak 900 mm bred tvåloppstrappa med tillhörande vilplan om ca 1,9 m², i terrazzoutförande. Typ produkten väger 3101 kg och levereras färdig, vaxad och skyddstäckt från fabrik. Dock är trappräcken inte inkluderade i beräkningen.\n",

CG Valsebeton anvendes som bærelag for vores Confalt SFB belægninger til alle typer af industri- og lagerhaller. Opbygningen kan i mange tilfælde være et alternativ til armerede betongulve. CG Valsebeton udlægges umiddelbart efter fundamenterne er støbt og skaber et stabilt, plant og vedligeholdesfrit underlag i byggeperioden, hvor der kan køres med mobilkraner, lifte og andet materiel til den efterfølgende byggeproces. CG Valsebeton kan også med store økonomiske og praktiske fordele anvendes til fastgørelse af skråstivere til montage af betonelementer. CG Valsebeton udlægges direkte ovenpå stabilgrus eller på hård isolering. Opbygningen tilpasses kundens forskellige behov og krav, noget der alene opnås gennem personlig rådgivning og individuelle løsninger. Blanding CG Valsebeton består af udvalgte kvalitetsbindemidler, herunder special kornkurve af støbemix tilsat cement. CG Valsebeton blandes på eget mobilt betonblandeanlæg eller købes direkte ved betonproducent. Udlægning For at opnå de bedste resultater for jævnhed, anvender vi den nyeste laserteknologi til vores specielle udlæggermaskiner. Et arbejdsteam kan udlægge 2-3000 m2 færdig CG pr. dag. CG Valsebeton udlægges i tykkelser fra 130 mm afhængig af belastning. Belastning Fladelast 200 KN/m2 Vores samlede opbygning med CG Valsebeton og Confalt kan klare belastninger på op til 100 KN på reolben som er 0,12 x 0,12 m. Trækstyrke i CG Valsebeton ved montage af elementstøtter er typisk 20-30 KN Dimensionering af gulvet udføres individuelt fra projekt til projekt. Arbejdstemperatur Frostfrit.\n",
