      "Description: the fibre materials arrive from various sources in bales which are broken open and the polypropylene packaging is removed. the fibre is then passed to the carding line, where it is weighed onto the belt and carded to give a fine web. the carded web passes to a needle puncher to produce a needle punched mat. this is edge trimmed, with the trimmings returned to the process. the mat then passes to the latex line to produce the fibre bonded sheet. for tiling products, a scrim is applied and this is needle punched. the scrim can be applied to the back, or it may be in the middle. the scrimmed mat then passes to the latex coater. after coating, drying and cooling, the scrimmed mat passes through rollers, prior to delivery to the bitumen coating line. the yarns for the tufted tile products arrive on bobbins from different sources. the yarns are applied to the scrim to give a loop pile, or a cut pile finish, before being transferred to the latex line. all material (tiled and fibre bonded sheet) passes through latex coater, after which it is oven dried in a mains gas-fuelled oven, then an ambient air cooler. tiled products are transferred to the bitumen coater, whereas the fibre-bonded mat products are not bitumen coated. in the bitumen line, a polypropylene and a glass fibre scrim are applied to the back of the mat as well as hot bitumen. the bitumen-backed material passes through calender rollers and then nip rollers, then an air cooler and finally over a water-cooled metal plate. the material is then cut on a guillotine, packed in cardboard boxes and wrapped in polyethylene before despatch. wastes arise from edge trimmings of finished tiles and carpets, plus some production rejects. there are also waste arisings from delivery packaging.\n",

      "Description: resourceco processes construction and demolition (candd) waste materials in south australia (sa) consisting of asphalt, concrete, bricks, and rubble. this waste is then used to manufacture a range of recycled aggregates products. resourceco receives candd waste from several sites close to the recycling facilities. the material is either dropped for free or received under a small fee. at the recycling facility, the candd waste are weighted in a weighbridge. the initial sorting gives three streams ferrous, non-ferrous (bricks, concrete, asphalt, masonry, etc), and non-recyclables. ferrous materials are sold as scrap and non-recyclables are sent to landfill (inert materials) or incineration for energy production (wood and plastics). non-ferrous materials are then sent to the crushing and screening steps. following this, they undergo grading and sorting based on their size. different size fractions, including coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and fill materials, are categorised. this grading process is crucial to ensure that the recycled aggregates conform to specific size and quality standards suitable for their intended use in construction projects. sorted products are stocked in pugmills or stockpiles before customer dispatch. some material undergoes a treatment with cement coating  this product has specific uses and the treatment happens after the recycled aggregate production described in this report. these products are not included in the epd. the feedstock materials before cement treatment are the same as the materials sorted ready to be stocked. hence, the cement treatment step was divided from the unit process into a sub-process that is outside this lcas scope. water is mostly used for dust control. dust control is also aided with an orange peel-based product. some water is also used in washing step of some of the aggregates. as there is no water measurement for the washing step, water is allocated as the other overheads.\n",

      "Description: the manufacture of hot bituminous mixtures consists of the combination of an asphalt bitumen, aggregates of controlled granulometry, mineral powder and, if necessary, additives, so that all aggregate particles are covered by a homogeneous film of binder. this process, like the commissioning, must be carried out at a temperature much higher than that of the environment. manufacturing usually takes place at temperatures close to 150 c, which is necessary to achieve complete drying of the aggregates, as well as to reduce the viscosity of the bituminous binder and obtain a correct wrapping. once produced, the hot bituminous mixtures are unloaded onto trucks with tipping bodies for transport to the place of use, where they are used to construct or rehabilitate layers of bituminous pavements and pavements.\n",

      "Description: -the product mainly consists of diisocyanate, polyol, and plasticizer around 45, 20, and 15 m.- with catalysts, colorant, and foaming agents. -the production process begins with the pol-mix production. this mixture is then used for the liquid component filling, after which the valve crimping is carried out to ensure the products integrity. the propellant filling stage follows, with an automatic weight check to ensure accuracy. can shaking, can cupping, and straw placement then take place. finally, the cans are packed and palletized for distribution. -no additional processes or raw materials are needed during the use stage of the assessed product. hence, modules b1 to b7 are not considered. -the end-of-life scenario for the products has been provided by henkel, where it is assumed that 60 goes to landfill whilst 40 goes to recycling operations. this scenario is more conservative than the one provided by eurostat for construction and demolition waste which has a higher recycling and landfilling operations rate (usually including more valuable materials than mortars such as metals).\n",

      "Description: the fibre materials arrive from various sources in bales which are broken open and the polypropylene packaging is removed. the fibre is then passed to the carding line, where it is weighed onto the belt and carded to give a fine web. the carded web passes to a needle puncher to produce a needle punched mat. this is edge trimmed, with the trimmings returned to the process. the mat then passes to the latex line to produce the fibre bonded sheet. for tiling products, a scrim is applied and this is needle punched. the scrim can be applied to the back, or it may be in the middle. the scrimmed mat then passes to the latex coater. after coating, drying and cooling, the scrimmed mat passes through rollers, prior to delivery to the bitumen coating line. the yarns for the tufted tile products arrive on bobbins from different sources. the yarns are applied to the scrim to give a loop pile, or a cut pile finish, before being transferred to the latex line. all material (tiled and fibre bonded sheet) passes through latex coater, after which it is oven dried in a mains gas-fuelled oven, then an ambient air cooler. tiled products are transferred to the bitumen coater, whereas the fibre-bonded mat products are not bitumen coated. in the bitumen line, a polypropylene and a glass fibre scrim are applied to the back of the mat as well as hot bitumen. the bitumen-backed material passes through calender rollers and then nip rollers, then an air cooler and finally over a water-cooled metal plate. the material is then cut on a guillotine, packed in cardboard boxes and wrapped in polyethylene before despatch. wastes arise from edge trimmings of finished tiles and carpets, plus some production rejects. there are also waste arisings from delivery packaging.\n",

      "Description: the manufacture of hot bituminous mixtures consists of the combination of an asphalt bitumen, aggregates of controlled granulometry, mineral powder and, if necessary, additives, so that all aggregate particles are covered by a homogeneous film of binder. this process, like the commissioning, must be carried out at a temperature much higher than that of the environment. manufacturing usually takes place at temperatures close to 150 c, which is necessary to achieve complete drying of the aggregates, as well as to reduce the viscosity of the bituminous binder and obtain a correct wrapping. once produced, the hot bituminous mixtures are unloaded onto trucks with tipping bodies for transport to the place of use, where they are used to construct or rehabilitate layers of bituminous pavements and pavements.\n",

      "Description: resourceco processes construction and demolition (candd) waste materials in south australia (sa) consisting of asphalt, concrete, bricks, and rubble. this waste is then used to manufacture a range of recycled aggregates products. resourceco receives candd waste from several sites close to the recycling facilities. the material is either dropped for free or received under a small fee. at the recycling facility, the candd waste are weighted in a weighbridge. the initial sorting gives three streams ferrous, non-ferrous (bricks, concrete, asphalt, masonry, etc), and non-recyclables. ferrous materials are sold as scrap and non-recyclables are sent to landfill (inert materials) or incineration for energy production (wood and plastics). non-ferrous materials are then sent to the crushing and screening steps. following this, they undergo grading and sorting based on their size. different size fractions, including coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and fill materials, are categorised. this grading process is crucial to ensure that the recycled aggregates conform to specific size and quality standards suitable for their intended use in construction projects. sorted products are stocked in pugmills or stockpiles before customer dispatch. some material undergoes a treatment with cement coating  this product has specific uses and the treatment happens after the recycled aggregate production described in this report. these products are not included in the epd. the feedstock materials before cement treatment are the same as the materials sorted ready to be stocked. hence, the cement treatment step was divided from the unit process into a sub-process that is outside this lcas scope. water is mostly used for dust control. dust control is also aided with an orange peel-based product. some water is also used in washing step of some of the aggregates. as there is no water measurement for the washing step, water is allocated as the other overheads.\n",

      "Description: resourceco processes construction and demolition (candd) waste materials in south australia (sa) consisting of asphalt, concrete, bricks, and rubble. this waste is then used to manufacture a range of recycled aggregates products. resourceco receives candd waste from several sites close to the recycling facilities. the material is either dropped for free or received under a small fee. at the recycling facility, the candd waste are weighted in a weighbridge. the initial sorting gives three streams ferrous, non-ferrous (bricks, concrete, asphalt, masonry, etc), and non-recyclables. ferrous materials are sold as scrap and non-recyclables are sent to landfill (inert materials) or incineration for energy production (wood and plastics). non-ferrous materials are then sent to the crushing and screening steps. following this, they undergo grading and sorting based on their size. different size fractions, including coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and fill materials, are categorised. this grading process is crucial to ensure that the recycled aggregates conform to specific size and quality standards suitable for their intended use in construction projects. sorted products are stocked in pugmills or stockpiles before customer dispatch. some material undergoes a treatment with cement coating  this product has specific uses and the treatment happens after the recycled aggregate production described in this report. these products are not included in the epd. the feedstock materials before cement treatment are the same as the materials sorted ready to be stocked. hence, the cement treatment step was divided from the unit process into a sub-process that is outside this lcas scope. water is mostly used for dust control. dust control is also aided with an orange peel-based product. some water is also used in washing step of some of the aggregates. as there is no water measurement for the washing step, water is allocated as the other overheads.\n",

      "Description: resourceco processes construction and demolition (candd) waste materials in south australia (sa) consisting of asphalt, concrete, bricks, and rubble. this waste is then used to manufacture a range of recycled aggregates products. resourceco receives candd waste from several sites close to the recycling facilities. the material is either dropped for free or received under a small fee. at the recycling facility, the candd waste are weighted in a weighbridge. the initial sorting gives three streams ferrous, non-ferrous (bricks, concrete, asphalt, masonry, etc), and non-recyclables. ferrous materials are sold as scrap and non-recyclables are sent to landfill (inert materials) or incineration for energy production (wood and plastics). non-ferrous materials are then sent to the crushing and screening steps. following this, they undergo grading and sorting based on their size. different size fractions, including coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and fill materials, are categorised. this grading process is crucial to ensure that the recycled aggregates conform to specific size and quality standards suitable for their intended use in construction projects. sorted products are stocked in pugmills or stockpiles before customer dispatch. some material undergoes a treatment with cement coating  this product has specific uses and the treatment happens after the recycled aggregate production described in this report. these products are not included in the epd. the feedstock materials before cement treatment are the same as the materials sorted ready to be stocked. hence, the cement treatment step was divided from the unit process into a sub-process that is outside this lcas scope. water is mostly used for dust control. dust control is also aided with an orange peel-based product. some water is also used in washing step of some of the aggregates. as there is no water measurement for the washing step, water is allocated as the other overheads.\n",

      "Description: the manufacture of hot bituminous mixtures consists of the combination of an asphalt bitumen, aggregates of controlled granulometry, mineral powder and, if necessary, additives, so that all aggregate particles are covered by a homogeneous film of binder. this process, like the commissioning, must be carried out at a temperature much higher than that of the environment. manufacturing usually takes place at temperatures close to 150 c, which is necessary to achieve complete drying of the aggregates, as well as to reduce the viscosity of the bituminous binder and obtain a correct wrapping. once produced, the hot bituminous mixtures are unloaded onto trucks with tipping bodies for transport to the place of use, where they are used to construct or rehabilitate layers of bituminous pavements and pavements.\n",

      "Description: -the product mainly consists of diisocyanate, polyol, and plasticizer around 45, 20, and 15 m.- with catalysts, colorant, and foaming agents. -the production process begins with the pol-mix production. this mixture is then used for the liquid component filling, after which the valve crimping is carried out to ensure the products integrity. the propellant filling stage follows, with an automatic weight check to ensure accuracy. can shaking, can cupping, and straw placement then take place. finally, the cans are packed and palletized for distribution. -no additional processes or raw materials are needed during the use stage of the assessed product. hence, modules b1 to b7 are not considered. -the end-of-life scenario for the products has been provided by henkel, where it is assumed that 60 goes to landfill whilst 40 goes to recycling operations. this scenario is more conservative than the one provided by eurostat for construction and demolition waste which has a higher recycling and landfilling operations rate (usually including more valuable materials than mortars such as metals).\n",

      "Description: the fibre materials arrive from various sources in bales which are broken open and the polypropylene packaging is removed. the fibre is then passed to the carding line, where it is weighed onto the belt and carded to give a fine web. the carded web passes to a needle puncher to produce a needle punched mat. this is edge trimmed, with the trimmings returned to the process. the mat then passes to the latex line to produce the fibre bonded sheet. for tiling products, a scrim is applied and this is needle punched. the scrim can be applied to the back, or it may be in the middle. the scrimmed mat then passes to the latex coater. after coating, drying and cooling, the scrimmed mat passes through rollers, prior to delivery to the bitumen coating line. the yarns for the tufted tile products arrive on bobbins from different sources. the yarns are applied to the scrim to give a loop pile, or a cut pile finish, before being transferred to the latex line. all material (tiled and fibre bonded sheet) passes through latex coater, after which it is oven dried in a mains gas-fuelled oven, then an ambient air cooler. tiled products are transferred to the bitumen coater, whereas the fibre-bonded mat products are not bitumen coated. in the bitumen line, a polypropylene and a glass fibre scrim are applied to the back of the mat as well as hot bitumen. the bitumen-backed material passes through calender rollers and then nip rollers, then an air cooler and finally over a water-cooled metal plate. the material is then cut on a guillotine, packed in cardboard boxes and wrapped in polyethylene before despatch. wastes arise from edge trimmings of finished tiles and carpets, plus some production rejects. there are also waste arisings from delivery packaging.\n",

      "Description: resourceco processes construction and demolition (candd) waste materials in south australia (sa) consisting of asphalt, concrete, bricks, and rubble. this waste is then used to manufacture a range of recycled aggregates products. resourceco receives candd waste from several sites close to the recycling facilities. the material is either dropped for free or received under a small fee. at the recycling facility, the candd waste are weighted in a weighbridge. the initial sorting gives three streams ferrous, non-ferrous (bricks, concrete, asphalt, masonry, etc), and non-recyclables. ferrous materials are sold as scrap and non-recyclables are sent to landfill (inert materials) or incineration for energy production (wood and plastics). non-ferrous materials are then sent to the crushing and screening steps. following this, they undergo grading and sorting based on their size. different size fractions, including coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and fill materials, are categorised. this grading process is crucial to ensure that the recycled aggregates conform to specific size and quality standards suitable for their intended use in construction projects. sorted products are stocked in pugmills or stockpiles before customer dispatch. some material undergoes a treatment with cement coating  this product has specific uses and the treatment happens after the recycled aggregate production described in this report. these products are not included in the epd. the feedstock materials before cement treatment are the same as the materials sorted ready to be stocked. hence, the cement treatment step was divided from the unit process into a sub-process that is outside this lcas scope. water is mostly used for dust control. dust control is also aided with an orange peel-based product. some water is also used in washing step of some of the aggregates. as there is no water measurement for the washing step, water is allocated as the other overheads.\n",

      "Description: the manufacture of hot bituminous mixtures consists of the combination of an asphalt bitumen, aggregates of controlled granulometry, mineral powder and, if necessary, additives, so that all aggregate particles are covered by a homogeneous film of binder. this process, like the commissioning, must be carried out at a temperature much higher than that of the environment. manufacturing usually takes place at temperatures close to 150 c, which is necessary to achieve complete drying of the aggregates, as well as to reduce the viscosity of the bituminous binder and obtain a correct wrapping. once produced, the hot bituminous mixtures are unloaded onto trucks with tipping bodies for transport to the place of use, where they are used to construct or rehabilitate layers of bituminous pavements and pavements.\n",

      "Description: the manufacture of hot bituminous mixtures consists of the combination of an asphalt bitumen, aggregates of controlled granulometry, mineral powder and, if necessary, additives, so that all aggregate particles are covered by a homogeneous film of binder. this process, like the commissioning, must be carried out at a temperature much higher than that of the environment. manufacturing usually takes place at temperatures close to 150 c, which is necessary to achieve complete drying of the aggregates, as well as to reduce the viscosity of the bituminous binder and obtain a correct wrapping. once produced, the hot bituminous mixtures are unloaded onto trucks with tipping bodies for transport to the place of use, where they are used to construct or rehabilitate layers of bituminous pavements and pavements.\n",
